## Overview

This repository contains the analysis of the Superstore dataset, which is a retail sales dataset from a fictional superstore. The dataset includes information about sales, profits, products, customers, and regions.

## Dataset Information

- Dataset Name: Superstore Dataset

- File Format: CSV (Comma Separated Values)

## Dataset Description

The Superstore dataset consists of several columns, including:

- `Order Date`: Date when the order was placed.
- `Ship Date`: Date when the order was shipped.
- `Customer ID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Customer Name`: Name of the customer.
- `Product ID`: Unique identifier for each product.
- `Product Name`: Name of the product.
- `Category`: Category to which the product belongs (e.g., Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies).
- `Sub-Category`: Sub-category of the product.
- `Sales`: Total sales amount for the order.
- `Profit`: Profit earned from the order.
- `Discount`: Discount applied to the order.
- `Region`: Region where the order was placed.
- `Segment`: Customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).

## Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into the sales and profitability of the superstore. The analysis explores various aspects of the dataset, including regional performance, product categories, customer segments, and their impact on profits. The findings aim to provide useful insights for business decision-making, marketing strategies, and overall store optimization.

## Reproducing the Analysis

To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Download the Superstore dataset (superstore_dataset.csv) from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bravehart101/sample-supermarket-dataset].
2. Install the required dependencies (e.g., Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (superstore_analysis.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis and visualize the results.

## Results and Conclusions

The analysis resulted in the following key insights:

1. Profit is high in the South & less in the Central part.
2. The highest profit is earned in copiers, while selling price for chairs & phones is extremely high compared to other products.
3. The Technology category has the highest number of products.
4. The West region has the highest number of transactions.
5. There is a negative correlation between profit & discount.
